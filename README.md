# MPRA

This file processes the raw data from Sharpr-MPRA experiments.

"The raw counts from the experiments were processed by (1) computing log2(RNA+1 / DNA+1) for each 145bp sequence in each of the 12 tasks (described below); (2) column-wise z-score normalization of the log fold-changes (i.e., each task's output values had mean 0 and variance 1); (3) including the reverse complement of each sequence as another datapoint with the same activity values."
